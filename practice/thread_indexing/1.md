<b>Problem 1: Manual Thread ID Calculation
Given these grid and block dimensions, calculate the global thread IDs manually:

Grid: dim3(3, 2, 1)

Block: dim3(4, 2, 1)

Task: For threads at positions:

blockIdx(1,0,0), threadIdx(2,1,0)

blockIdx(0,1,0), threadIdx(3,0,0)

blockIdx(2,1,0), threadIdx(1,1,0)

Calculate their global IDs using your formula and show your work</b>

<b><i>Answer: </i></b>

for this we have the formula like 
```cpp
int blockId = blockIdx.x + blockIdx.y * gridDim.x + blockIdx.z * gridDim.x * gridDim.y;
int block_offset = blockId * blockDim.x * blockDim.y * blockDim.z;
int thread_offset = threadIdx.x + threadIdx.y * blockDim.x + threadIdx.z * blockDim.x * blockDim.y;
int global_id = block_offset + thread_offset;
```

for the first one : blockId = 1
                    block_offset = 8
                    thread_offset = 6
                    id = 8 + 6 = 14

for the second one : blockId = 3
                     block_offset = 24
                     thread_offset = 3
                     id = 24 + 3 = 27

for the third one : blockId = 5
                    block_offset = 40
                    thread_offset = 5
                    id = 40 + 5 = 45
