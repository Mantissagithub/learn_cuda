<b>Problem 2: Reverse Engineering
Given:

Grid: dim3(2, 3, 2)

Block: dim3(4, 3, 2)

Global thread ID = 157

Task: Work backwards to find what blockIdx and threadIdx values would produce this global ID.</b>

<b><i>Answer: </i></b>

if the global threadid = 157, then 
block_offset + thread_offset = 157
(blockIdx.x + blockIdx.y * 2 + blockIdx.z * 6) * 24 + (threadIdx.x + threadIdx.y * 4 + threadIdx.z * 12) = 157

if blockIdx = 0,0,0
threadIdx.z = 12 
threadIdx.y = 3
threadIdx.x = 1

if threadIdx = 0,0,0

157/24 is not possible, so lets say 144/24 is a valid thing we need 13 from threads

threadIdx = (1, 0, 1) is a valid one

then (blockIdx.x + blockIdx.y * 2 + blockIdx.z * 6) = 6
(6, 0, 0), (4, 1, 0), (2, 2, 0)  ....
