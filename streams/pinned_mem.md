# PINNED MEMORY

So the issue without a locked memory (aka <i><b>Pinned Memory</b></i>) is that, let's say we store an amount of mem needed for the kernel, but as the ram gets full, it goes into the swap memory, leading or the gpu to check in the ram first, and then if its not present go to the swapped mem and access it. But this slows down the process, so pinned mem what it does is that, lock some mem in ram, and stores it there itself no matter what, and the gpu gets access for dma(direct memory access without cpu intervention), and then access the data, this is something like caching optimization moving from a system of cache miss to optmizing the caching algo üòÅ.

The code block to insert in everything is that
```
cudaMallocHost(x, size)
```

some diagrams for more clarity though
